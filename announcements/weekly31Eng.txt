Hello!

I hope everyone's having a good week, we've been quite busy with a bunch of new players thanks to the Steam sale. Hello new players!

This week brings in a 3rd game mode called Custom Mode.

[h1]Custom Mode[/h1]
This third game mode allows players to turn on/off various modifiers to create and share unique challenges! This can be unlocked by unlocking the "My Lucky Day" achievement, which is done by winning a Daily Climb.

Our aim is to expand this mode to allow new challenges such as Endless mode (which is still being worked on in Beta) and eventually allow players to create, incorporate, and access mods through this flexible interface :).

[h1]Controller Support[/h1]
Additional work and support is still coming! Lots of work was done this week to enable functionality and fix bugs related to Custom mode.

[h1]One Million?![/h1]
Just a few days ago, we reached 1,000,000 players for Slay the Spire! It's been a wild ride as the two of us (and a great number of collaborators!) started work on this game almost 3 years ago. The feedback and reception for the game has been far more than any developer could hope for and we'd like to sincerely thank all of you for playing the game, creating amazing content, and even starting riots over boots.

We hope to pay you all back by working our butts off.
