Hey everyone,

It's been quite a while since release. The past few months have been pretty busy with ports and the patching of those ports but we wanted to update the PC version to contain all of the fixes, optimizations, and quality of life changes we worked on during this process.


[h1]What’s in the Works?[/h1]
[list]
[*]All the ports! Eventually, you'll be Slaying the Spire on your smart fridge (not really, but never say never).
[*]Additional translations.
[*]Free DLC containing a 4th character and additional content.
[/list]


[h1]Official Merchandise!?[/h1]

Whoa, did we team up with Fangamer and now you can get an awesome Slay the Spire shirt by Nina Matsumoto? Yes. Get one [url=https://www.fangamer.com/products/slay-the-spire-shirt]here![/url]

We'll be getting more merch soon. Stay tuned!


[h1]Touchscreen Compatibility[/h1]
A lot of work has been put into ensuring that players who use touchscreen computers (or Steam Link on mobile) can enjoy the game fully!

Two-step confirmations have been added to several screens so you can review options before you choose a card/boss relic/shop item. To turn this on, toggle the Touchscreen Mode option found at the bottom of the Input Settings screen.


[h1]Community Fan Art[/h1]
The amount of fan art we received since release is outrageous and we’re happy to have inspired so many brilliant works of art! Let’s take a look:

[h1]Modding[/h1]
While we’ve tried our best to keep backwards compatibility as stable as possible, many performance and UX improvements that were added will inevitably break some mods.

For this release we worked a lot closer with our modding community and very grateful for sharing their insights in making the game more modder friendly, bug free, and generally helping the community stay informed of upcoming changes.

These kind folks include (but aren’t limited to) BDWSSBB, Blank The Evil, brianfubar, Evil Pickle, and kioeeht. They have done tons of optimizations, fixes, moddability improvements, and even features like the sort bar in deck view screen! As always, if you have questions about modding or want to get into modding yourself, visit the [url=https://discord.gg/slaythespire]Slay the Spire Discord’s #modding channel![/url]

Maybe just stop by to thank a modder for all their hard work :).

Version 1.0 of Slay the Spire (January 23, 2019) will be archived in the Steam branch: [V1.0] and can be found in the BETAS tab for the game (Similarly to how you would access the beta branch).
