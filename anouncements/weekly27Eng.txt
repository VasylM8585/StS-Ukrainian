Hey world,

This week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!

[h1]The Third Character[/h1]
It's finally here! Those of you who tested out the character in beta, we sincerely thank you for your feedback and gameplay data. The first two characters took about a year of balancing and reworking, it really helps us work faster to get all of your input.

[b]Content:[/b]
[list]
[*]A new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.
[*]75 Cards.
[*]9 Relics.
[*]3 Achievements.
[*]Additional lore in the Sensory Stone event.
[/list]

[h1]Controller Support[/h1]
Still trying a few things here and there while fixing up critical issues and usability quirks. We aim to get this ready for main branch in a few weeks, but it's been quite challenging! We're learning a lot about controllers.

[b]Patch Notes[/b]

[h1]Content[/h1]
[list]
[*]New colorless card: Magnetism.

[h1]Bug Fixes[/h1]

[*]Boot relic now triggers on 4 or less rather than 5, this caused it to flash when it did nothing.
[*]Closing discard or draw pile view screen can no longer reopen in some cases.
[*]Egg relics now show pre-upgraded cards for Sensory Stone event's choices.
[*]Empty save files now treated as corrupted (some files were getting deleted, sorry).
[*]End of turn Relics and Orbs now trigger after all cards are fully played.
[*]Fix for Bottled cards showing up in Wheel of Change event's Purge result.
[*]Fixed an instance of players losing progress due to slow storage write speeds.
[*]Fixed bug where Elite BGM plays if you load into a reward screen (post-combat).
[*]Fixed issue where Common Sense achievement was not triggering correctly.
[*]Fixed issue where loading saves would modify source relics rather than copies.
[*]Fixed issue where playing cost X cards quickly after energy gain cards failed. Offering -> Whirlwind

[*]Game data now loads attempts to load a backup if the main save is corrupt.
[*]You can no longer select/click things while the game is fading out during Save & Quit.
